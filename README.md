# Financial-Dashboard-Next.js
A simplified financial dashboard full-stack web application, following https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app .

The dashboard will have:
- A public home page.
- A login page.
- Dashboard pages that are protected by authentication.
- The ability for users to add, edit, and delete invoices.
- An accompanying database.

This project will help provide the skills needed to use Next.js in my own personal projects.
