# Financial-Dashboard-Next.js
A simplified financial dashboard full-stack web application, following https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app.


Deployed to https://financial-dashboard-next-js-gilt.vercel.app.

Log in to view the dashboard with the following credentials:
- Email: user@nextmail.com
- Password: 123456
(note: feel free to create and delete invoices, I probably won't be checking in on it.)

The dashboard has:
- A public home page.
- A login page.
- Dashboard pages that are protected by authentication.
- The ability for users to add, edit, and delete invoices.
- An accompanying database.

This tutorial project helped provide the skills needed to use Next.js in my own personal projects.
